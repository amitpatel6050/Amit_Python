n=5
sum=0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    sum=sum+i
print("sum : ",sum)


'''n=5 and sum=0 for first value and n+1 means every time +1 add
first loop sum=sum+i means 0+1 now sum value is 1
second loop sum=sum+i means 1+2 now sum value is 3
third loop sum=sum+i means 3+3 now sum value is 6
four loop sum=sum+i means 6+4 now sum value is 10
five loop sum=sum+i means 10+5 now sum valie is 15
so answer is 15'''
